Basic Student Management System
The Student Management System is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of student profile data, as well as their academic records. Students can access the system in read-only mode by logging in with their registered mobile number and date of birth. Administrators or teachers, on the other hand, can log in using their employee ID and password, granting them full access to read, write, and update data. This system is an effective tool for managing student information and monitoring their academic progress while minimizing errors and improving data accuracy
